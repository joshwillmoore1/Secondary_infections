# Secondary_infections

This repository contains the source code for manuscript entitled: "Secondary Household Covid-19 Transmission Modelling of Students Returning Home from University" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.20229559)

The Matlab folder contains the orginal Monte-Carlo algorithm used for stochastic simulations for secondary infections from university students returning to their primary address. This was later converted into a web-based application using R which can be found here: http://bit.ly/Secondary_infections_app. The source code for the shiny application can be found in the shiny folder.
